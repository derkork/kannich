## Introduction

Kannich is a somewhat complex piece of software that is maintained by me in my spare time. As such, there are some constraints on how updates and support will be handled.

## Updates

I will release updates to Kannich as they are completed. These updates may include new features, bug fixes, performance improvements, or security fixes. In general, neither features nor bugfixes will be backported to older versions. In case of a critical bug that affects a large number of users, I might consider backporting a fix to an older version. Expect this to happen only in exceptional cases.

## Support

You can report issues or ask for help in the [GitHub issue tracker]({{site.issue_tracker}}). Questions about how to use the plugin are marked with the `Knowledge` label, so you can [filter]({{site.issue_tracker}}?q=is%3Aissue%20label%3Aknowledge%20) for them to find answers for questions that others have asked already.
